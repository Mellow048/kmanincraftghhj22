/**
 * What If You Could See Who Had a Crush on You
 *
 * TODO: the film in three sentences. The power, what the teller used it for, and what it was really doing.
 *
 * A "WHAT IF" film (Topics/WhatIf): a kid gets one impossible power and tells what happened. The recorded
 * narration is the clock, and every line of narration.md is one shot. Read Topics/WhatIf/README.md before
 * changing anything here.
 *
 * This is the one-to-two-minute film. `cut: "long"` is the three-minute one.
